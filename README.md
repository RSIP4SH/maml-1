# maml
maml implementation (MNIST)

a minimal implementation of Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) by Finn et al.

This codes re-factorized the codes written by Finn (https://github.com/cbfinn/maml), and much lighter than the origianl codes.

MNIST dataset is used : 5 / 5 classes are used for training / testing, respectively. 1000 instances are used for each class (you can change the option).
