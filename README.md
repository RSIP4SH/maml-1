# maml
maml implementation (MNIST)

a minimal implementation of Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) by Finn et al.


This repository is a refactoring of the code written by Finn, the original paper author (https://github.com/cbfinn/maml). 

MNIST dataset is used : 5 / 5 classes are used for training / testing, respectively. 1000 instances are used for each class (you can change the option).
